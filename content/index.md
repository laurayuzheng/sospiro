**Welcome to my page!!**

This website is a personal project of mine.
I would like to create a space on the internet that encapsulates as much about me as possible, sort of like a collage.
My plan is that, over time, I can populate this page with all the things I like, my random thoughts, and anything else that might not be appropriate to put on a professional website.
Ironically, this will be hosted on the same Github I use to post research projects for professional development. 
If you found this website, welcome!! I probably won't be advertising this. 
This will just be a little easter egg for those who care enough to look.

I've been on the internet since I was 7. 
A lot of my online friends back then were much older and had cool, vintange-looking websites. 
To me, their websites were the ultimate form of free self expression.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make my own at the time, and lost contact with all of those people. 
They should be at least 35 now---I hope I can reconnect with them one day. 

This page is still under construction, tho. :)) More to come in the future.
