**Welcome to my page!!**

I decided to make this webpage to serve as somewhat of a personal collage. 
I hope that, over time, I can populate this page with all the things I like, my random thoughts, and anything else that might not be appropriate to put on a professional website.
Web development is not my strong suite, so maybe this will take a while. But anyways, thanks for visiting my site! Feel free to look around. My interests are the best interests.

I've been on the internet since I was 7. 
A lot of my online friends back then were much older and had cool websites. 
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make my own. Plus, I lost contact with a lot of them. 
Their glittery, flashing websites sit at the back of my mind all the time!! 
So now, years later, I've impulsively decided I wanted to make my own. 
Those older kids probably don't even remember me anymore--they might be 35 now, actually. 
Anyways, I saw somewhere on Twitter (sorry, I am still not calling it X) that each person is a mosaic of all the people they loved. 
I hope that this website can be a repersentation of that mosaic for me. 

This page is still under construction, tho. :)) More to come in the future.
